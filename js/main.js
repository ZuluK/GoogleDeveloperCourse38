For this quiz, use jQuery to set up an event listener. Your event listener must:
    1. listen to the #my-button element
    2. listen for a `click` event
    3. perform the following actions when the button is clicked:
        a. remove the #my-button element from the DOM
        b. add the `success` class to the body
*/

$("#my-button").on("click", function(){
    $('#my-button').remove();
    $(document.body).addClass('success')
});
